Scholarly Technology Group Software Development Guidelines

These documents are intended to serve as a guide to both new and current software development team members.  This hopefully will facilitate the ramp-up of new team members, ensure consistency across the team and lead to the development of high-quality, maintainable software.

STG typically includes 2-3 graduate student programmers, each of which typically works with us for 1.5-2 years, so turn-over is a given.  Thus, our software development processes need to be optimized for adding new team members and maintaining the contributions that they make while theyâ€™re here.

We intend to continually iterate, refine, and experiment with the various practices in this document.  Thus, this will be a living document.
