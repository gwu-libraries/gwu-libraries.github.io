Source control
===========

Software projects are hosted on [github](https://github.com/).

Unless there is a compelling reason, all repositories should be:

* under the [gwu-libraries](https://github.com/gwu-libraries) organization
* be public
* use an MIT license
* provide a [README.md](http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/latest/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/#readme).
* provide an appropriate .gitignore.
