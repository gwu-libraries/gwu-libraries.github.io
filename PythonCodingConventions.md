Python coding conventions
=====================

* Code should comply with [Pep8]( http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/); exceptions should be intentional and rare.
* Code author has primary responsibility for Pep8 compliance.
* Code reviewers should verify Pep8 compliance before approving a pull request.
* Pep8 checkers are already provided in some IDEs; [other options](Tools.md) are available.
