Python lint testing
=============

* Code should pass a lint test without errors or warnings; exceptions should be intentional and rare.
* Code author has primary responsibility for lint checking.
* Code reviewers should verify a successful lint check before approving a pull request.
* Lint checkers are already provided in some IDEs; [other options] (Tools.md) are available.
